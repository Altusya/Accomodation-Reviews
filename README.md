# Accomodation-Reviews
create a personalized hotel recommendation system that considers user reviews and ratings. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to provide users with tailored suggestions, enhancing their overall experience in selecting the best hotel for their specific requirements.

Tools and Technologies

To implement the hotel recommendation system, we will use the Python programming language along with the following libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and computations.
Data visualization.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For Natural Language Processing tasks.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about hotels, including customer reviews and ratings.
